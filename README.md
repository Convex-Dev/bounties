# Bounties

Repository for the Convex Bounty programme. Earn Convex Coins for solving problems and building new capabilties!

## How it works

You can earn a bounty by solving a challenge with a bounty. Bounties are listed as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Convex-Dev/bounties/issues) in this repository.

## Rules

1. A bounty is earned when a solution to the problem posed is accepted as a PR on Github for a relevant open source project managed by the Convex Foundation

2. PRs will be accepted by a core team member if it is considered to solve the problem posed, and is acceptable in terms of completeness (documentation, test cases, good code quality etc.)

3. If two solutions are both considered acceptable, the earliest complete PR will be awarded the bounty.

4. The bounty will be awarded to the primary GitHub user who submits the PR, who shall be regarded as the lead contributor. If mutliple contributors have worked together on the PR, it is the responsibility of the lead contributor to distribute any shares of the bounty at their own discretion, or according to any arrangements made privately within the team.

5. Before receiving the bounty, the lead contributor must specify the Convex Account by providing an Ed25519 Public Key (64 hex digits). It is the contributor's responsibility to ensure that they possess the corresponding private key and keep it secure, otherwise their bounty may be lost.

6. The bounty will be paid into the specified Convex Account after the the launch of the Convex main network.

7. Bounties are awarded at the discetion of the Convex Foundation. In the event of any dispute, the Foundation's decision is final.
